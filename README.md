This is the Glassfish 4 server for my other project Cabinetron Client.

This is the server for the Cabinetron inventory management software that my partner, Steven Petroff, and I worked on for our Applied Software Engineering class. It connects to a MySQL database and a Java EE Bean so that the server can update inventory on other clients when it needs to.
